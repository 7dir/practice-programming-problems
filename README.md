# practice-programming-problems
The programming solutions in this repository are for the problems given in different programming competitions and other sample problems.
It's fun to solve them using different programming languages instead of using just one language!

* Update 02.20.2016 -- There are problem solutions in this repository that are not for the problems in the FEU Tech Java Fest 2015
* Update 04.07.2016 -- Code snippets from my side projects were included: vending_machine.py & gmail_check.py
* Update 04.17.2016 -- Program for my Numerical Analysis (04065) subject: error_analysis.py
* Issue  04.21.2016 -- Precision numbers of operands causes an issue with the results of error_analysis.py
